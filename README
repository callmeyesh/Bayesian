1. INTRODUCTION

E-mail is an increasingly common form of communication. In this project
we evaluate the performance of naive bayesian classification on PU1 
corpus. 
The corpus can be found at http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/publications.html

2. FEATURES

Bayesian requires the user to specify the path to the data-set folder.
It does a 10-fold validation on the data-set and outputs the classifiers
accuracy, precision, error rate, recall and specificity.
 
3. HOW TO START THE SOFTWARE

CCIS LINUX MACHINE (standard configuration)

Step 1. Start the Terminal Application.  
Step 2. Move to the directory where you have down-loaded the software.  
Step 3. Extract the down-loaded software into a desired folder.
Step 4. Move to the directory where you have extracted the software and
        execute the following command:

        $ java Bayesian <dir>

        where
		<dir> is the path to one of the four data-sets.
		 
NOTE: 
The PU1-encoded corpus provided contains 4 data-sets:
i.   Unmodified (bare)
ii.  With Lemmatizer's removed (lemm)
iii. With Lemmatizer's and stop-words removed (lemm_stop)
iv.  With stop-words removed (stop)
The user should provide the absolute path to anyone of these four data-sets.
